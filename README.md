There are 2 ways that We can use in order to sort a certain amount of number; one is faster than the other but both of them are really good. In the first case we can try the so called 'Devide and Conquer' method: We shall deal with a certain list of number and using this strategy we can 'simplify' the problem. Everything is based on the 'Pivot' or 'Central Element' wich we use to devide the list of numbers in 2 smaller lists, and we can do that until we need it. Now we can devide the remaining numbers (except for the pivot) in 2 parts, the numbers that are smaller than the pivot and the ones that are bigger; at the end we are going to have all the numbers that we had orginized and sorted from the smallest to the biggest. Now the second method is a little longer but not less effective: We shall consider the same bunch of  numbers from before, now instead of deviding using the Pivot, We'll still use the 'Devide and Conquer' but We devide our numbers in 2 lismallee groups, and We do so, until We reach only one number. The best case would be of having a list that is already sorted of course, but considering the case of a comppletely disordered list, We'll each number with the following one until We reach the perfect order of the list. As said before, This second method is a little more time consuming but the result would still be the same.
